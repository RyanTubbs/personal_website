              <p class="card-text-8 p-2">And by "here", I mean inland Southern California, where I’ve been based since 1999. I grew up in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owens_Valley">Owens Valley</a>, in the shadow of the Sierra Nevada, not far from where this hairy mountain man was photographed. Not exactly an exotic location, but rural enough so that I experienced a bit of culture shock when I moved to the Big City. I’ve been on quite a journey over the past 18 years, both geographically and vocationally. Keep scrolling for a quick tour of the career rabbit holes I’ve disappeared into over the years.</p>

              <p class="card-text-8 pl-2 pr-2 pt-2 pb-0 mb-0">I worked for two different ambulance companies during this period, <a href="http://www.symonsambulance.com/">Symons Ambulance</a> in Bishop and <a href="https://www.amr.net/">American Medical Response</a> in Redlands. This was my introduction to some of the harsher realities of life. I learned how to mop up bodily fluids in the back of an ambulance without vomiting, worked the night shift, performed CPR numerous times, treated gunshot and traffic accident victims, and navigated through traffic with emergency lights flashing and sirens blaring.</p> 
              <p class="card-text-8 p-2">These were all fantastic, character-building experiences, and I was no longer a sheltered young kid when I left this career behind to attend college full time. I can’t believe I don’t have any photographs of myself in my EMT uniform, but instead you can enjoy this pretty picture of Birch Mountain, which I could see out of my bedroom window when I was a boy.</p>

              <p class="card-text-8 pl-2 pr-2 pt-2 pb-0 mb-0">My first post-college job was a position as a social worker for developmentally disabled adults at the nonprofit <a href="https://www.inlandrc.org/">Inland Regional Center</a>. With a caseload of clients that sometimes exceeded 70 people, this is where I really learned how to prioritize and multitask. It was my first office job, and I had to quickly learn how to maneuver within a large bureaucracy.</p>  
              <p class="card-text-8 p-2">The primary focus of the position was arranging a variety of social services for my disabled clients. Sounds simple enough, right? Well, despite its relatively non-technical nature, I count this job as the most difficult that I have held to date. I’m proud of myself for sticking with it for five years, although I often did come home and fall asleep in my chair, as can be seen here (and apparently I didn't cut my hair very often). I left right as the Great Recession was tearing through state budgets and spent nearly the next two years as a stay-at-home dad for my two young children.</p>

              <p class="card-text-8 pl-2 pr-2 pt-2 pb-0 mb-0">No, I’m not making this up. I really did work as an archaeologist. I’d wanted to be an archaeologist ever since I did a report on Pompeii in Mr. McGuigan’s seventh grade history class. So when the opportunity arose to attend an archaeological field school, I couldn’t say no. I spent five weeks camping with a bunch of grubby college kids and learning how to survey, excavate, and identify artifacts. A few months later, I was employed full time at <a href="http://www.ecorpconsulting.com/">ECORP Consulting, Inc.</a>, where I worked for over five years.</p> 
              <p class="card-text-8 p-2">Although the fieldwork was often physically demanding, and the technical reports often had to be written under tight budget constraints, I enjoyed this job tremendously. I got to work outside frequently, find cool old stuff, and then write about it; I’ve even got a second author credit in a <a href="http://www.pcas.org/documents/MasonandTubbs.pdf">journal article</a>. Mr. McGuigan would be proud. Unfortunately, the nature of the job necessitated frequent travel away from my family, and when my position was eliminated due to company restructuring, I realized it was time to find a rabbit hole closer to home.</p>
