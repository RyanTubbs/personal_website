              <p class="card-text-8 p-2">And by "here", I mean inland Southern California, where I’ve been based since 1999. I grew up in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owens_Valley">Owens Valley</a>, in the shadow of the Sierra Nevada, not far from where this hairy mountain man was photographed. Not exactly an exotic location, but rural enough so that I experienced a bit of culture shock when I moved to the Big City. I’ve been on quite a journey over the past 18 years, both geographically and vocationally. Keep scrolling for a quick tour of the career rabbit holes I’ve disappeared into over the years.</p>

              <p class="card-text-8 pl-2 pr-2 pt-2 pb-0 mb-0">I worked for two different ambulance companies during this period, <a href="http://www.symonsambulance.com/">Symons Ambulance</a> in Bishop and <a href="https://www.amr.net/">American Medical Response</a> in Redlands, along with a brief stint working in the emergency room at <a href="https://www.dignityhealth.org/socal/locations/stbernardinemedical">St. Bernardine Medical Center</a> in San Bernardino. This was my introduction to some of the harsher realities of life. I learned how to mop up bodily fluids in the back of an ambulance without vomiting, worked the night shift, performed CPR numerous times, treated gunshot and traffic accident victims, and navigated through traffic with emergency lights flashing and sirens blaring.</p> 
              <p class="card-text-8 p-2">These were all fantastic, <a href="https://riteshjsr.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/ch9004211.gif">character-building</a> experiences, and I was no longer a sheltered young kid when I left this career behind to attend college full time. I can’t believe I don’t have any photographs of myself in my EMT uniform, but instead you can enjoy this pretty picture of Birch Mountain, which I could see out of my bedroom window when I was a boy.</p>

              <p class="card-text-8 pl-2 pr-2 pt-2 pb-0 mb-0">My first post-college job was a position as a social worker for developmentally disabled adults at the nonprofit <a href="https://www.inlandrc.org/">Inland Regional Center</a>. With a caseload of clients that sometimes exceeded 70 people, this is where I really learned how to prioritize and multitask. It was my first office job, and I had to quickly learn how to maneuver within a large bureaucracy.</p>  
              <p class="card-text-8 p-2">The primary focus of the position was arranging a variety of social services for my disabled clients. Sounds simple enough, right? Well, despite its relatively non-technical nature, I count this job as the most difficult that I have held to date. I’m proud of myself for sticking with it for five years, although I often did come home and fall asleep in my chair, as can be seen here (and apparently I didn't cut my hair very often). I left right as the Great Recession was tearing through state budgets and spent nearly the next two years as a stay-at-home dad for my two young children.</p>

              <p class="card-text-8 pl-2 pr-2 pt-2 pb-0 mb-0">No, I’m not making this up. I really <em>did</em> work as an archaeologist! I’d wanted to be an archaeologist ever since I did a report on Pompeii in Mr. McGuigan’s seventh-grade history class. So when the opportunity arose to attend an archaeological field school, I couldn’t say no. I spent five weeks camping with a bunch of grubby college kids and learning how to survey, excavate, and identify artifacts. A few months later, I was employed full time at <a href="http://www.ecorpconsulting.com/">ECORP Consulting, Inc.</a>, where I worked for over five years.</p> 
              <p class="card-text-8 p-2">Although the fieldwork was often physically demanding, and the technical reports often had to be written under tight budget constraints, I enjoyed this job tremendously. I got to work outside frequently, find cool old stuff, and then write about it; I’ve even got a second author credit in a <a href="http://www.pcas.org/documents/MasonandTubbs.pdf">journal article</a>. Mr. McGuigan would be proud. Unfortunately, the job required frequent travel away from my family, and when my position was eliminated due to company restructuring, I realized it was time to find a rabbit hole closer to home.</p>

              <p class="card-text-8 pl-2 pr-2 pt-2 pb-0 mb-0">Pretty wild career trajectory, huh? So how does an EMT/Social Worker/Archaeologist end up working in the tech sector? In part, it’s the fulfillment of another childhood dream. My first exposure to computers and programming was via the green monochrome screen of an Apple IIe in my fifth-grade classroom. Although my vocational interests initially led me elsewhere, I always enjoyed tinkering with computers, and I’ve recently allowed that interest to blossom fully. I’ve acquired basic scripting ability in both Python and JavaScript (including jQuery), I have a solid understanding of CSS3, HTML5, Bootstrap, the Git workflow, and I’ve worked a bit with API requests and JSON. Most of my experience thus far has focused on front-end stuff, but I’m beginning to toy with the back end as well. I’ve also got a current CompTIA A+ certification. I’m excited by how deep this rabbit hole goes!</p>  
              <p class="card-text-8 p-2 mb-1">I enjoy meeting interesting people, so I’d love to hear from you. Please feel free to contact me with questions, business opportunities, or even if you’d just like to tell me to wipe that silly smirk off my face.</p>
